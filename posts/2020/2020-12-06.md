Had a small, distant get together at the riverfront spot for Justin's birthday. Happy birthday, Justin! <p>As we pulled up, we could see a bright light and a lot of smoke. We thought maybe someone had beat us there or that some other people entirely had their own party going. Turns out there had just recently been a large trash fire that smelled horrible and was still burning, and the bright lights were from a tugboat on the river keeping an eye on the fire. Made for some good lighting.<p>
