If you're ever in Midtown NYC, I can't recommend Jimmy's Corner enough.

This guy was something else. Real drunk, real chatty, and really wanted us to meet him at the Bjork DJ set happening later under the Brooklyn Bridge. So much so that he insisted I take a picture of his ticket so I could use it. He said if it doesn't work, just run in anyway and I'll be fine. I did not try that.

It just so happened that Freddie Gibbs had a show on the night of my birthday, which coincidentally happened two years ago and we made the trek for. This one was w/ Madlib, even better.

The show was right on the river across from Brookyln.
