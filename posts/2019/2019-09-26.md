After a couple days relaxing in the woods, we said goodbye to New Mexico and headed for Utah. My Mormon upbringing makes me dislike Utah for fundamental reasons, but damn what a beautiful place...

I'm lucky to have a dog that's into traveling as much as I am. What a lil boss, I love this girl. We've seen a lot together.
